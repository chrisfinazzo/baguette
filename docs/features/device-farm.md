# Device Farm

Multi-device dashboard for the iOS Simulator. One browser tab shows
every booted simulator, with click-to-focus, gesture input on the
selected device, and Grid / Wall / List view modes.

Lives at `GET /farm` under `baguette serve`.

If you want the end-to-end tap-to-`UITouch` story, read
[`../ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md). This doc is scoped to the
farm feature itself — what the UI does, why it's split the way it is,
and the few non-obvious decisions worth pinning down.

## Why

A single-device stream page (`/simulators/<udid>`) was already in
place. Two real workflows pushed for a fleet view:

- **Multi-device QA** — eyeball the same screen across iOS 18.2,
  iOS 26.0, iPad, and Watch at once during a localization or
  regression sweep.
- **Demos / device-farm style hosting** — share one URL and let a
  reviewer pick a device, drive it, and move on without fishing for
  UDIDs.

The constraint was strict: don't fork the streaming pipeline. Each
device's WebSocket already supports per-stream control
(`set_bitrate` / `set_fps` / `set_scale` / `force_idr` / `snapshot`)
and gesture dispatch on the same channel. A farm view is a thin
client over that — N concurrent sessions, one focused at a time.

## Surface

```
GET /farm                 → farm/farm.html (shell)
GET /farm/:file           → farm/<file>    (CSS + per-component JS)
```

Only two new server routes; the resource bundle gained a `farm/`
subfolder. Everything else (per-device WS, lifecycle POSTs, chrome
JSON, bezel PNG) is the same surface the single-device page uses.

`WebRoot.data(named:)` learned to resolve nested paths
(`farm/farm.html`) so the bundle's directory structure matches the
served URL structure — no rewriting, no flat-file aliasing.

## Page layout

```

Three content columns separated by a resize handle, one main row,
plus header + footer. The CLI mirror
footer reflects the current filter / focus state as a Baguette
invocation — useful for copy-paste reproduction.

The focused-device pane starts at 420 px and can be resized by dragging
its left divider. It is bounded to 260–720 px while reserving at least
320 px for the fleet view whenever the viewport permits. Arrow keys resize the focused pane when the
divider has keyboard focus; Home/End select its bounds, and double-click
restores 420 px. The selected width is stored in
`localStorage.baguette.farm.focusWidth`, then re-clamped when the browser
window changes size. Making the pane narrower also shortens portrait
device previews, which keeps the full screen visible on displays using
large OS scaling without zooming the whole page.

## Frontend split

`Resources/Web/farm/` mirrors the IIFE-on-`window` pattern the
single-device page already uses. No bundler, no module graph;
`<script>` tags load in dependency order.

```
farm.html         shell — loads scripts in order
farm.css          design tokens + Grid / Wall / List + focus styles

farm-views.js     pure DOM renderers (one fn per view + sub-region)
farm-tile.js      FarmTile: per-device StreamSession + canvas + mirror
farm-focus.js     FarmFocus: focus-pane chrome (telemetry, controls)
farm-focus-width.js adjustable focus-pane width + persisted preference
farm-filter.js    FarmFilter: facet state + predicate (extractable)
farm-app.js       FarmApp: orchestrator (boot, render, dispatch)
```

Each script hangs one class on `window`. `farm-app.js` is the only
stateful module; everything else is pure functions or per-device
classes.

### View renderers are pure

`farm-views.js` exports `renderHeader`, `renderRail`, `renderGrid`,
`renderWall`, `renderList`, etc. Each takes a host element + a
`ctx` object and writes DOM. No fetches, no listeners, no global
state. `FarmApp` re-runs them when filter / view / sort / selection
changes — the renderers stay re-runnable and trivially diff-testable.

### One tile = one StreamSession

`FarmTile` owns:

- **`canvas`** — the `StreamSession`'s draw target. Lives in its
  grid host for the entire life of the tile. Re-parented across
  Grid / Wall / List re-renders by `attach(host, opts)`, but never
  moved on selection.
- **`mirror`** — a second `<canvas>` redrawn from `canvas` via a
  `requestAnimationFrame` copy loop. Mounted in the focus pane
  while focused. Uses `drawImage(src, 0, 0)` per tick — deterministic
  bitmap blit, no `captureStream` fragility.

That split means selection only affects the focus pane:

- The grid tile keeps its canvas painting in place. **Zero DOM swap
  in the grid on selection** — no flash, no orphan moments.
- The focus pane mounts the mirror, starts the copy loop, runs at
  full quality. On clear-focus, the mirror is detached and the rAF
  loop stops.

Why a copy-canvas instead of `canvas.captureStream() → <video>`? In
practice `captureStream` is fragile across browsers — the produced
track sometimes stalls silently while the source canvas keeps
drawing. A direct `drawImage` is one bitmap blit, no autoplay or
codec edge cases, and easy to reason about.

### Bezel mode

A "Show bezels" toggle in the rail wraps each tile's canvas in a
Baguette SDK `Simulator` instance (the same composition `Baguette.use`
returns on the single-device page). On enable, FarmApp fetches every
booted device's `definition.json` in parallel and caches it in a
`Map<udid, SimulatorDefinition>`. Each tile mounts its sim via
`new _Simulator(def, transport).mount(host)` and grafts its own
live canvas in place of the bezel's freshly-minted one, so bezel +
per-button overlays + screen + keyboard all wire up in one call.
Grid tiles detach screen input post-mount (`sim.screen.detach()`)
so clicks on the screen surface select the tile rather than tapping
the device; the focus mirror keeps full input.

`FarmTile._mountIn` carries a fit-inside computation: the wrapper
gets explicit pixel `width`/`height` matching the bare composite's
aspect ratio (`def.screen.viewport.width / .height`) while staying
inside the host's bounding box. That keeps every device's bezel
correctly proportioned regardless of container size — including the
squarish ones (Apple Watch) where the original `max-width: 100%`
strategy distorted screen-area percentages.

### Gesture input

`SimInputBridge` is a small shared module (under `Resources/Web/`)
that translates `SimInput`'s asc-cli plugin dialect to Baguette's
GestureRegistry wire format. Both `sim-stream.js` and `farm-tile.js`
use it.

When a tile is focused, `FarmTile.wireInput()` attaches a
`MouseGestureSource` + a `PinchOverlay` to the **mirror canvas in
the focus pane** (not the grid canvas). Mouse coords normalize
against the listener element's bounding box, so the focus pane is
the right target — that's the one the user clicks.

Modifiers mirror sim-stream:

- no modifier → 1-finger tap / swipe
- ⌥ + drag → 2-finger pinch (mirrored through screen center)
- ⌥ + ⇧ + drag → 2-finger parallel pan
- ⌃ + wheel / Safari `gesture*` → pinch stream

Only `home` and `lock` round-trip cleanly today (per `Press.swift`);
the focus pane wires the rest of the hardware-button row
(Vol+, Vol−, Snap UI, Rotate) so they activate as soon as
`DeviceButton` is widened in Domain.

## Streaming policy

Each booted device runs one MJPEG stream over the existing per-device
WebSocket. Two profiles:

| profile | fps | scale | bitrate |
| ------- | ---:| -----:| -------:|
| THUMB   | 8   | 4     | 600 kbps |
| FULL    | 60  | 1     | 6 Mbps  |

Selecting a tile sends the FULL config; clearing focus drops back to
THUMB. Both go over the standard `set_fps` / `set_scale` /
`set_bitrate` reconfig protocol — no new endpoints.

This is a pragmatic tradeoff between fleet bandwidth (N devices ×
THUMB) and focused-device quality (1 × FULL). It can be tuned in
`farm-tile.js` by changing the two config dicts.

## View modes

- **Grid** — primary view. Cards with bezel + status pip + readout.
  Fixed-height (`320px`) screen container, bezel sized to fit so
  rows align across mixed device shapes.
- **Wall** — uniform 3:4 monitor-wall panels. Top strip carries
  status pip + channel; bottom strip carries device name + FPS.
  Bezel optional (honors global toggle).
- **List** — dense data table. Click-to-sort columns, inline
  sparkline-ready FPS column, hover-revealed quick actions.

Switching views re-runs the renderers and reparents tile canvases
into whichever new screen-host elements got rendered. The streaming
pipeline is undisturbed.

## Filtering

`FarmFilter` (in `farm-filter.js`) owns four facets:

- **platforms**: `iphone` / `ipad` / `watch` / `tv` (inferred from
  device name)
- **runtimes**: discovered from `/simulators.json`, seeded into the
  filter as devices arrive
- **states**: `live` / `boot` / `idle` / `off` / `error` (mapped
  from CoreSimulator state strings)
- **search**: free-text over name + UDID + runtime + platform

`apply(devices)` is a pure predicate; counts come from `counts(devices)`
for the rail's "(N)" badges. The class is small, dependency-free,
and unit-testable in isolation.

## Bulk actions

The rail has four bulk buttons: Boot Filtered, Snapshot All, Reset
Streams, Shutdown Filtered. They fan out per-device POSTs against
the existing `/simulators/<udid>/boot|shutdown` endpoints (no new
bulk endpoints yet). After a boot/shutdown cycle, FarmApp refetches
`/simulators.json` and starts/stops tiles to match.

## Telemetry

Per-tile FPS comes from `StreamSession.onFps`. `FarmApp` rolls them
up into the header's "Aggregate FPS" stat. Other header stats
(bandwidth, P50 latency) are placeholders today — wiring them
needs server-side instrumentation that doesn't yet exist.

The focus pane's gauges (FPS, Latency P95, Bitrate, Memory) are
similarly partial — FPS is real; the rest are display-only until
the server reports them.

## Known limits

- **Concurrency cap is empirical.** Streaming N MJPEG decoders at
  60 fps is fine; at 8 fps it's cheaper, but past ~16 simultaneous
  thumbs the browser starts dropping rAF ticks on lower-end Macs.
  No automatic backpressure today.
- **Bulk endpoints don't exist yet.** Bulk actions are client-side
  fan-outs; if 30 devices boot at once they'll all serialize through
  the framework warm-up.
- **Saved layouts / persistent groups** aren't built. The "Groups"
  section in the rail is a static placeholder.
- **Aggregate telemetry is partial** (see above).

## Surface deltas vs. single-device page

| concern              | `/simulators/<udid>`   | `/farm`                       |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| streams per page     | 1                      | N (one per booted device)     |
| stream profile       | full quality           | thumb (fleet) + full (focus)  |
| input target         | the canvas             | the mirror (in focus pane)    |
| selection effect     | n/a                    | mirror swap + input wire only |
| bezel toggle         | always on              | rail toggle                   |

Both pages share `stream-session.js`, `frame-decoder.js`, and the
Baguette SDK (`Resources/Web/baguette/`) for bezel + buttons +
screen + keyboard. The farm page adds five files in
`Resources/Web/farm/` and two server routes — that's the entire delta.

## Extension points

- **New view mode**: add a renderer in `farm-views.js` and a case in
  `FarmApp.render()`. Tiles attach to `[data-screen-host]` regardless
  of markup.
- **New filter facet**: add a `Set` to `FarmFilter` and a UI section
  in `renderRail`. The predicate already pattern-matches on
  `filter[facet]` lookups.
- **New per-device action**: wire it on the focus pane preset row
  and forward to `FarmTile`. Gesture-shaped actions can land in
  `Domain/Input/`; stream-control verbs ride the existing reconfig
  protocol.
- **New bulk operation**: extend `FarmApp.runBulk()` and the rail's
  `[data-bulk]` button row.

## Testing approach

The frontend is currently exercised manually via the live UI; a
later iteration could add a thin DOM test harness around
`farm-views.js` (pure renderers, easy to fake state).

The new server routes have a Swift Testing suite at
`Tests/BaguetteTests/Server/WebRootSubdirTests.swift` covering the
nested-path lookup `WebRoot` learned. Higher-level routing tests
would benefit from a Hummingbird router fixture — not yet in the
repo.
