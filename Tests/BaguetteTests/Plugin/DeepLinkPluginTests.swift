/// official plugin you still choose to install. The cost of that choice
/// is that nothing in the build would notice a manifest that stopped
/// parsing — `serve` skips a bad manifest with a log line, so a broken
/// official plugin would present as a rail entry that silently never
/// appears. These tests are what notices.
