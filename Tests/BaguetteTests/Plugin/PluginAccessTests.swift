/// The question every request asks before a handler runs: is this a
/// plugin, and if so may it be here?
///
/// Three answers, not two. `anonymous` is the important one — a request
/// with no grant isn't claiming to be a plugin at all, so it must fall
/// through to the browser-trust check exactly as it did before plugins
/// existed. Collapsing that into "refused" would break `curl` and the
/// browser; collapsing it into "granted" would make the grant optional,
/// which is the same as not having one.
