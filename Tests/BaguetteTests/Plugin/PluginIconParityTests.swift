/// The icon set exists twice — `PluginIcon` here, the `ICONS` map in
/// `sim-plugins.js` — and until this suite nothing checked they agreed.
///
/// The duplication is deliberate and not removable: the Swift side is
/// the parse boundary that stops manifest text reaching the DOM, and the
/// JS side holds the actual SVG paths, which have no business in a Swift
/// enum. What *was* removable is the failure mode. The two files carried
/// a comment asking a human to keep them in sync, and a comment is not a
/// mechanism: adding a case to one and forgetting the other ships a
/// plugin that passes `baguette plugin validate` and then draws the
/// wrong glyph, which nothing would have caught.
///
/// Reading in this direction on purpose — `allCases` is exact, so only
/// the JS half needs parsing, and a regex is applied to the file that
/// can afford one.
