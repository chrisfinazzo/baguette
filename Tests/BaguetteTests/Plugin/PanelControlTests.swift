/// Tickable rows — switches, checkboxes and radios.
///
/// The behaviour this replaces is `display.py` writing `"● Light"` /
/// `"○ Dark"` into row *titles*: a plugin drawing a control glyph inside
/// a string, in a page whose premise is that the host owns every pixel.
/// It was safe (everything is escaped) but not right — the host couldn't
/// style it, a screen reader read a bullet, and "which one is on" was
/// legible only to a human eye.
///
/// So the row says what's *on* and the manifest says what *on looks
/// like*. Ticking is local and batched: the panel accumulates ticks and
/// submits them together, which buys one subprocess per batch instead of
/// one per tick, at the cost of rows briefly showing unconfirmed state.
