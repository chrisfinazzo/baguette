/// Pure-value coverage for `LocationWalk` — the joystick's vector
/// (origin + bearing + speed) and its projection onto the
/// `LocationRoute` simctl already understands.
///
/// The mechanism this type exists to serve: `simctl location set` pins a
/// point with `course == -1` (no direction of travel), so a joystick
/// built on repeated `set` calls could never drive `CLLocation.course`.
/// A two-waypoint `start` route makes locationd *derive* course and
/// speed from real interpolated motion — verified against a booted sim,
/// where a due-east route reported `Speed,25.00,Course,90.00`. So a walk
/// is modelled as a vector and projected into a route whose far waypoint
/// lies along the bearing.
