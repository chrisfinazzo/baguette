/// The named presets, pinned to Network Link Conditioner's own numbers.
///
/// Borrowing NLC's vocabulary *and* its figures is the point: `3g` then
/// means what every iOS developer already means by 3G, and nobody has to
/// defend a number baguette invented. These tests exist so the figures
/// can't drift silently — a preset quietly getting faster would make a
/// passing test suite while apps stopped being tested against 3G.
///
/// Two deliberate translations from NLC, both covered below:
///
/// - **NLC's delay is one-way.** A request pays it outbound and again
///   inbound, so a preset's `latencyMs` — which baguette applies once, before
///   the first byte — is twice NLC's figure.
/// - **NLC conditions uplink and downlink separately.** baguette paces the
///   response body only, so a preset carries NLC's *downlink* bandwidth.
