/// Coverage for `MotionIntent` — the payload baguette publishes into the

///
/// It is an **intent**, not a sample: it says "the device is running at
/// 3.6 m/s, it started at T, and N steps had already accrued before this
/// leg". The dylib integrates from that. Streaming samples would be
/// impossible — a pedometer accumulates monotonically and
/// `CMMotionManager` delivers at up to 100 Hz.
///
/// Every number the dylib needs is pre-resolved here, including the raw
/// CoreMotion enum values, so the ObjC side carries no policy it could
/// disagree with.
