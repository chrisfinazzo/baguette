/// Pure-value coverage for `MotionLedger` — the running totals a

/// A pedometer is **cumulative**: an app that charts a day's steps must
/// see them keep climbing across a walk → stop → walk sequence. Every
/// change of intent therefore banks what the previous leg earned, and the
/// banked figure rides along in the next intent as `stepsBefore` /
/// `distanceBefore`. This value is that banking, and it lives in Swift so
/// the arithmetic is tested rather than trusted to the dylib.
