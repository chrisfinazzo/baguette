/// Orchestration coverage for `SimctlSimulatorInjection` — argv assembly
/// and the `Subprocess` exit handshake for arming a dylib into a
/// simulator's launchd domain.
///
/// Arming is a **read-modify-write**: `launchctl getenv` first, merge via
/// `InjectedDylibs`, then `setenv` (or `unsetenv` when nothing is left).
/// That's what lets the camera and motion dylibs coexist in one
/// `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` instead of clobbering each other.
///
/// The irreducible `xcrun` spawn lives in `HostSubprocess`
/// (integration-only), so every branch here is driven through
/// `MockSubprocess`.
