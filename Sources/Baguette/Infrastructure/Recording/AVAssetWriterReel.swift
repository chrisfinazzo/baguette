/// and a presentation time; this type opens the writer, composites the

/// `docs/features/recording.md` rejects server-side recording for the
/// live-stream / device-farm case because it would add an N+1th
/// VideoToolbox session next to the one each booted device already runs
/// for its live AVCC stream, and because an `ffmpeg -c copy` tap never
/// sees the SPS/PPS `H264Encoder` emits on its first IDR. `baguette
/// record` has no competing live stream and owns the encode from frame
/// one, so neither objection applies. This type is not reachable from
