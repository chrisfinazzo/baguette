/// The browser half of plugin distribution: preview a bakery, list the
/// ones you trust, and install from those. In its own file like
/// `ServerPluginRoutes`.
///
/// Previewing clones a repo into the cache and reads its menu, which is
/// as powerful as `boot`/`shutdown` and rides the same browser-trust
/// gate (`rejectUntrustedBrowser` — Origin / `Sec-Fetch-Site` /
/// DNS-rebind).
///
/// **Installing rides a second gate on top of that one.** It copies
/// files into a directory whose contents baguette later executes, and
/// the only thing standing in front of a browser route is a set of
/// origin heuristics — well tested, but heuristics. So the install
/// route takes a bakery's **recorded id**, never a URL or a git ref:
/// the page can only reach a source already in `bakeries.json`, at the
/// commit pinned there. If an origin check is ever wrong, the blast
/// radius is "installs a plugin from a repo you already vetted" rather
/// than "clones anything and writes it to your disk".
///
/// **Trusting a new source still isn't something a page can do.** A
/// modal button isn't real consent — the page sets the flag it then
/// checks — so `bakery add` stays a terminal act and preview still
/// ends by handing you the command. See `InstallDecision`.
