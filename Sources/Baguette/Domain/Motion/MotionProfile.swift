///
/// A pedometer accumulates monotonically and `CMMotionManager` delivers at
/// up to 100 Hz — neither can be fed sample-by-sample from the host
/// through a file. So the dylib synthesises locally. To keep that ObjC
/// side dumb (and therefore un-unit-testable only in the parts that don't
/// matter), **every judgement call lives in this value** and the dylib
/// does nothing but linear integration and a sine at the cadence it's
/// handed. Same division as the browser: the frontend sends, Swift decides.
