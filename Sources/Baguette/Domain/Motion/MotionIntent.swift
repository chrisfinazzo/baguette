/// `CMPedometer` counters must accumulate monotonically and
/// `CMMotionManager` delivers at up to 100 Hz. Neither can be fed
/// sample-by-sample from the host through a file, so the dylib integrates
/// locally from this description. `stepsBefore` / `distanceBefore` carry
/// the totals from earlier legs, which is what makes a pedometer
/// cumulative across a walk → stop → walk sequence instead of resetting
/// every time the joystick moves.
///
/// Everything the dylib needs is pre-resolved: `activityType` and
/// `confidence` are the raw CoreMotion numbers, and `profile` is the gait
/// policy. `kind` rides along as a word purely so the file is legible to
/// a human debugging it.
