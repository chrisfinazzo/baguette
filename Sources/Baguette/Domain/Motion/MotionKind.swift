///
/// ## Why this is derived from speed
///
/// The simulator has no motion coprocessor, so nothing classifies motion
/// for us: `CMMotionActivityManager.isActivityAvailable()` is `false` and
/// locationd refuses the subscription outright (see
/// `docs/features/motion.md`). baguette supplies the classification
/// itself, and the only honest input it has is the speed the device is
/// being driven at by a walk or a route.
///
/// The thresholds are pinned to the speed presets the browser's Walk mode
/// already offers — `Walk 1.4 · Run 3.5 · Cycle 6 · Drive 13.4 ·
/// Highway 29` (m/s) — so the label a user picked in the UI is the label
/// the app under test observes. They're band *midpoints*, not the preset
/// values themselves, so a hand-typed speed near a preset still lands on
/// the intended side.
