/// ## Why a ledger exists at all
///
/// A pedometer is cumulative. An app charting a day's steps must see them
/// climb across a walk → stop → walk sequence, so every change of intent
/// **banks** what the previous leg earned; the banked figure then rides
/// along inside the next `MotionIntent` as `stepsBefore` /
/// `distanceBefore`, and the dylib simply adds the leg it is currently
/// integrating on top. Without this, grabbing the joystick would reset the
/// day's step count.
///
/// The arithmetic lives here, in tested Swift, rather than in the dylib.

    /// `speed × elapsed`, so an app can never read a distance that
    /// disagrees with the step count handed to it alongside.

    /// `startedAt` in the future) banks nothing: a cumulative counter must
