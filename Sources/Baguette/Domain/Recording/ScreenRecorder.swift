/// Records a simulator's screen onto a `Reel`.
///
/// The value-domain half of `baguette record`: subscribe to the
/// `Screen`, resolve the requested `CaptureSize` against the first frame
/// the simulator actually delivers, pace arrivals onto the requested
/// frame rate, stop at the requested duration, and report what was
/// written. Every one of those is a decision, so all of it is here and
/// unit-tested; the `AVAssetWriter` conversation lives behind `Reel`.
///
/// ## Why a server-side recorder is right *here* and wrong for `serve`
///
/// `docs/features/recording.md` records that server-side recording was
/// tried for the live-stream / device-farm case and rejected twice over:
/// an `ffmpeg -c copy` tap never sees the SPS/PPS that `H264Encoder`
/// emits only on the first IDR, and a parallel `Screen` subscription
/// with its own `AVAssetWriter` adds an N+1th VideoToolbox session on
/// top of the one every booted device already runs for its live stream,
/// which makes every farm tile stutter.
///
/// Neither reason survives the standalone CLI. `baguette record` owns
/// the encode from the very first frame (so there is no mid-stream
/// attach and no keep-alive duplicate to propagate), and it has no
/// competing live stream (so its VideoToolbox session is the only one).
/// The rejected approach is therefore the *correct* approach here — and
/// only here. This type is deliberately not reachable from
/// `baguette serve`; the browser stays the recorder for live sessions.
