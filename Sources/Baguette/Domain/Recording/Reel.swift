/// This is the conversational boundary `baguette record` talks to the
/// outside world across — `AVAssetWriter` wants a back-and-forth (start
/// a session, feed it a buffer with a presentation time, finish and
/// flush), which is exactly the shape CLAUDE.md's second adapter pattern
/// calls for: one small `@Mockable` collaborator named as a domain noun,
/// with the orchestration (`ScreenRecorder`) depending on `any Reel` and
/// unit-tested through `MockReel`. The concrete `AVAssetWriterReel` is a
/// thin wrapper and stays integration-only.
///
/// The reel receives the raw simulator surface plus the `CapturePlacement`
/// it was opened with, and does the letterbox/crop compositing itself —
/// that is a GPU blit, not a decision. Every *decision* (how big, where
/// the frame lands, which frames make the cut) is already settled in the
/// domain before a reel ever sees a pixel.
