/// the screen is still. A recording asked for 30 fps therefore can't
/// just take every surface: it keeps the first, then the next one that
/// arrives at least one frame-interval later, measured **from the frame
/// it actually kept** rather than from an absolute grid (a late frame
/// shouldn't drag every following slot early to "catch up").

/// Nothing is invented to fill a gap. A still screen produces no
/// surfaces, so the last kept frame simply stays on screen until the
/// next one arrives — which is exactly what the user saw.
