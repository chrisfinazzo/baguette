/// How a bandwidth becomes the two numbers the injected dylib paces a
/// response body with: release `bytesPerTick` every `tickIntervalMs`.
///
/// ## Why the host computes this
///
/// Same division motion established — **policy in tested Swift, arithmetic
/// in the dylib.** Choosing a tick that is smooth without thrashing a timer,
/// and keeping the delivered rate honest when a tick works out to a
/// fraction of a byte, are judgement calls; the dylib should hold a budget
/// and subtract from it, nothing more.
///
/// ## Why the interval moves and the byte count doesn't
///
/// The obvious shape is "fixed 50 ms tick, however many bytes that is". It's
/// wrong at the slow end: a link where a tick is 6.25 bytes rounds to 6 and
/// then quietly delivers 4% less than asked. So the rounded byte count is
/// taken as given and the **interval** is derived back from it, which makes
/// the delivered rate exact at every bandwidth.
