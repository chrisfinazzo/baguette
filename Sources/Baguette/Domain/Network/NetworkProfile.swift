///
/// ## Why NLC's vocabulary and NLC's numbers
///
/// Every iOS developer already knows what NLC means by `3G` and
/// `Very Bad Network`, and those figures have been the shared reference for
/// a decade. Inventing baguette's own would mean defending them, and would
/// make two apps "tested on 3G" mean different things. So the words and the
/// figures both come across, and `NetworkProfileTests` pins each one — a
/// preset quietly getting faster would otherwise leave a green suite while
/// apps stopped being tested against the network they claim.
///
/// ## Two deliberate translations
///
/// - **NLC's delay is one-way**, paid outbound and again inbound.
///   `NetworkCondition.latencyMs` is the whole round trip — the figure a
///   developer means by "300 ms of latency" — so each preset doubles NLC's.
/// - **NLC conditions uplink and downlink separately.** baguette paces the
///   response body only, so a preset carries NLC's *downlink* bandwidth and
///   uploads run at full speed. Stated plainly in the docs rather than
///   papered over.
