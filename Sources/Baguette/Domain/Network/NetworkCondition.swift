/// negative latency or a zero bandwidth reads to whoever is testing as "the
/// app is broken", days after anyone remembers arming it. So the failable
/// initialiser is the **only door**, exactly as `Coordinate`'s is.

/// `latencyMs` is what a request waits in total before its first byte —
/// the figure a developer means by "300 ms of latency". Network Link
/// Conditioner instead states a *one-way* delay that traffic pays twice, so
/// `NetworkProfile` doubles NLC's numbers on the way in.
