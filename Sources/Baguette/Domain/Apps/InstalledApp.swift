///
/// 1. `xcrun simctl listapps <udid>` gives the authoritative roster —
///    which apps are installed, what they're called, and crucially each
///    one's real `Path` on disk. What it does *not* give is
///    `CFBundleURLTypes`: the command reports a curated subset of
///    metadata, and URL types aren't in it (verified against Xcode 26).
/// 2. `<Path>/Info.plist` gives the schemes, from the same key the app
///    declared them under.
///
/// Taking the path from step one is what makes step two safe. Reading
/// `Info.plist` means touching CoreSimulator's container layout, whose
/// `…/Containers/Bundle/Application/<uuid>/` shape is undocumented and
/// whose UUID changes on every reinstall — but we never have to *guess*
/// it, because simctl just told us. Both parses are pure and live here;
/// `SimctlApps` runs the child, reads the file, and composes them.
