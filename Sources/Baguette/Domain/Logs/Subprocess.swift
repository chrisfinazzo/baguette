/// A long-running child process that streams stdout bytes and
/// terminates with an exit code. The orchestrator
/// (`SimDeviceLogStream`) uses one to host
/// `xcrun simctl spawn <udid> log stream …`, but the abstraction
/// is generic — anything that needs a piped, terminable child
/// could depend on it.
///
/// The bytes-and-exit shape is deliberately conversational —
/// `run` kicks the child off, `onBytes` fires repeatedly as
/// stdout fills, `onExit` fires once when the child winds down.
/// The orchestrator threads its own state machine through these
/// callbacks; this abstraction just relays the OS-level signals.
///
/// Stderr is pooled with stdout — log binaries that emit
/// `getpwuid_r` warnings or "Filtering the log data using …"
/// banners send those to stderr, and we want them in the same
/// line stream as the actual entries. Callers that need the two
/// separated will need a richer collaborator.
