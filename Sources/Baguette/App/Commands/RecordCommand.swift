/// tap never sees the SPS/PPS `H264Encoder` emits only on its first IDR,
/// and a parallel encode adds an N+1th VideoToolbox session next to the
/// one every booted device already runs for its live stream, which makes
/// every farm tile stutter. A standalone `record` has no competing live
/// stream and owns the encode from frame one, so neither objection
/// applies here. Nothing in this command is reachable from `baguette
/// serve`; the browser stays the recorder for live sessions.
