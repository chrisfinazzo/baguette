/// The one behaviour that distinguishes this from `xcrun simctl openurl`
/// is the warning: an `https://` universal link dispatches fine and then
/// opens **Safari** rather than the app, because the simulator doesn't
/// resolve associated domains the way a device does. Every existing tool
/// does this silently, leaving the developer to guess whether their
/// entitlement, their apple-app-site-association file, or the simulator
/// is at fault. `DeepLink.routing` names the case, so we say it out loud
/// before dispatching.
